# PontiNet [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mpontikes/mpontikes.github.io.svg?branch=PTickets)](https://travis-ci.org/mpontikes/mpontikes.github.io)
<br />
A series of websites compiled using Webpack that I make to test out different aspects of web design. This is the code behind those sites. Feel free to look around at the different source files in the 'src' folder. If you want to add your own page to the site, PRs are always welcome! (All sites load from mpontikes.github.io/'yourFileName') PontiNet can also be pulled(downloaded) for offline use. If you wish to add your own site, be sure to run 'npm install' first. The compiler can be used by running 'npm run compile' for one time or 'npm run dev' for continuous.
<br />
### Home
This is the page with all the sites on PontiNet that are avaliable to the public. This should not include sites for special events or sites that are unfinished. These sites can be accessed through the password field (Password is the name of the html file in the root).
